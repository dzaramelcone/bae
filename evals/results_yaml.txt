E   AssertionError: Expected no code blocks, got 1.
E   Response:
E   In bae, a **Graph** is a container that manages a collection of nodes and their dependencies. It's the core execution engine that:
E   
E   1. **Resolves dependencies** - Figures out what nodes need to run based on what you request
E   2. **Executes nodes** - Runs them in the correct order, respecting their dependency relationships
E   3. **Caches results** - Stores computed values so they don't need to be recomputed
E   4. **Manages state** - Keeps track of the node namespace and their values
E   
E   ```python
E   # %% exec
E   from bae import Graph, Node, Dep
E   from typing import Annotated
E   
E   class A(Node):
E       val: int = 5
E   
E   class B(Node):
E       a: Annotated[int, Dep(A.val)]
E       val: int = lambda self: self.a * 2
E   
E   # Create a graph and run it
E   g = Graph()
E   result = g.run(B.val)
E   print(f"Result: {result}")  # Will compute A.val=5, then B.val=10
E   ```
E   
E   The graph acts like a smart calculator - you tell it what you want (like `B.val`), and it automatically figures out it needs to compute `A.val` first, then uses that to compute `B.val`.

E   Response:
E   A **Graph** in bae is a container that holds multiple nodes and manages their execution and dependencies.
E   
E   Key points:
E   
E   1. **Container for Nodes**: A Graph groups related nodes together into a logical unit
E   2. **Dependency Resolution**: It automatically resolves dependencies between nodes based on their type annotations
E   3. **Execution Management**: Handles running nodes in the correct order based on their dependencies
E   4. **Composable**: Graphs can contain other graphs as nodes, allowing hierarchical composition
E   
E   Basic example:
E   
E   ```python
E   from bae import Graph, Node
E   
E   class AddOne(Node):
E       x: int
E       
E       def run(self):
E           return self.x + 1
E   
E   class Double(Node):
E       x: int
E       
E       def run(self):
E           return self.x * 2
E   
E   # Create a graph with nodes
E   graph = Graph(
E       add=AddOne(x=5),
E       double=Double(x=Dep(AddOne))  # depends on AddOne's output
E   )
E   
E   # Execute the graph
E   result = graph()  # Runs AddOne first, then Double with AddOne's result
E   ```
E   
E   The Graph ensures nodes execute in dependency order and handles passing outputs between nodes automatically.

E   AssertionError: Expected no code blocks, got 1.
E   Response:
E   In bae, a **Graph** is a collection of nodes that represents a computation or workflow. It's the core abstraction for building and executing complex operations.
E   
E   Key characteristics:
E   
E   - **Composed of Nodes**: A Graph contains Node instances that define individual computation steps
E   - **Manages Dependencies**: Automatically resolves dependencies between nodes (using `Dep` annotations)
E   - **Execution Engine**: Can execute the entire graph or specific nodes, handling the dependency chain
E   - **Type-Safe**: Leverages Python's type system to ensure correct data flow between nodes
E   
E   Here's a simple example:
E   
E   ```python
E   from bae import Graph, Node, Dep
E   from typing import Annotated
E   
E   class FetchData(Node):
E       data: str = "hello"
E   
E   class ProcessData(Node):
E       input: Annotated[str, Dep(FetchData)]
E       output: str
E       
E       def run(self):
E           self.output = self.input.upper()
E   
E   # Create and execute the graph
E   g = Graph(nodes=[FetchData(), ProcessData()])
E   result = g.execute()
E   ```
E   
E   The Graph handles figuring out that `ProcessData` needs `FetchData` to run first, executes them in order, and returns the results.

E   Response:
E   Dep is a dependency injection marker used in the cortex framework. It allows you to declaratively specify that a field should be populated by calling a function, rather than being provided directly.
E   
E   When you annotate a field with `Dep(func)`, the framework automatically calls `func` when the object is created and uses its return value to populate that field.
E   
E   ```python
E   # %% exec
E   from typing import Annotated
E   from cortex import Node, Dep
E   
E   # Example: a function that will be called to fetch data
E   def fetch_user_name():
E       return "Alice"
E   
E   def get_timestamp():
E       return "2026-02-14"
E   
E   # Node with dependency injection
E   class UserProfile(Node):
E       name: Annotated[str, Dep(fetch_user_name)]
E       created_at: Annotated[str, Dep(get_timestamp)]
E       bio: str  # regular field, provided directly
E   
E   # Create instance - Dep fields are auto-populated
E   profile = UserProfile(bio="Software engineer")
E   print(f"Name: {profile.name}")
E   print(f"Created: {profile.created_at}")
E   print(f"Bio: {profile.bio}")
E   ```
E   
E   The key benefit is separation of concerns: you define *what* data a node needs (via the type annotation) and *how* to get it (via the Dep function), and the framework handles the wiring automatically.

E   Response:
E   In **bae** (a Python framework), a **Graph** is a data structure that represents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of computational nodes. Here are the key concepts:
E   
E   ## Core Idea
E   A Graph organizes **Nodes** into a dependency network where:
E   - Each node represents a computation or data transformation
E   - Edges represent data flow dependencies between nodes
E   - Nodes execute in topological order (respecting dependencies)
E   
E   ## Key Features
E   
E   1. **Node Dependencies**: Nodes can depend on outputs of other nodes using the `Dep()` annotation
E   2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The graph doesn't execute until you explicitly run it
E   3. **Composability**: You can build complex workflows by connecting simple nodes
E   4. **Type Safety**: Uses Python type hints and Pydantic for validation
E   
E   ## Basic Example Structure
E   ```python
E   from bae import Node, Graph, Dep
E   
E   class FetchData(Node):
E       data: str
E   
E   class ProcessData(Node):
E       processed: Annotated[str, Dep(FetchData)]
E   
E   # The graph automatically resolves dependencies
E   graph = Graph(ProcessData)
E   result = graph.run()
E   ```
E   
E   ## Benefits
E   - **Declarative**: Define *what* should happen, not *how*
E   - **Reusable**: Nodes are modular and can be shared
E   - **Debuggable**: Clear execution flow and dependency tracking
E   - **Scalable**: Can handle complex multi-step workflows
E   
E   The Graph essentially manages execution order and data passing so you focus on defining individual computational steps.

E   Response:
E   In **bae** (a Python library/framework), a **Graph** is a data structure that represents computational workflows or pipelines.
E   
E   Here are the key characteristics:
E   
E   1. **Node-based architecture**: A Graph is composed of interconnected Nodes, where each Node performs a specific computation or task.
E   
E   2. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Graphs typically follow a DAG structure, meaning data flows in one direction without cycles, making execution order deterministic.
E   
E   3. **Data flow**: Data moves between nodes through their inputs and outputs. Each node takes inputs, processes them, and produces outputs that can feed into other nodes.
E   
E   4. **Lazy evaluation**: Graphs often use lazy evaluation—they don't compute until explicitly executed, allowing for optimization of the computation plan.
E   
E   5. **Dependencies**: Nodes can depend on outputs of other nodes, and the Graph automatically handles dependency resolution and execution ordering.
E   
E   **Example structure**:
E   ```python
E   class MyGraph(Graph):
E       input_node = Node(...)
E       processing_node = Node(input=input_node.output)
E       output_node = Node(input=processing_node.output)
E   ```
E   
E   Graphs are useful for:
E   - Building ML pipelines
E   - Creating complex workflows with multiple processing stages
E   - Enabling parallel execution where possible
E   - Making computations reusable and composable
E

E   Response:
E   In **bae** (a Python data manipulation library), a **Graph** is a data structure that represents relationships between entities. Here are the key aspects:
E   
E   ## Core Concept
E   A Graph in bae allows you to model connections between nodes/vertices, where each connection can have associated data (edges). It's useful for representing:
E   - Network structures
E   - Hierarchical relationships
E   - Dependencies
E   - Social connections
E   - Any data with relational patterns
E   
E   ## Key Features
E   - **Nodes**: The entities or vertices in the graph
E   - **Edges**: The connections between nodes, which can be directed or undirected
E   - **Attributes**: Nodes and edges can have associated data/properties

E   ## Common Operations
E   - Adding/removing nodes and edges
E   - Traversing the graph (DFS, BFS)
E   - Finding paths between nodes
E   - Analyzing connectivity and structure
E   
E   ## Typical Usage Pattern
E   ```python
E   # Conceptual example (syntax may vary)
E   g = Graph()
E   g.add_node(1, label="Node1")
E   g.add_node(2, label="Node2")
E   g.add_edge(1, 2, weight=5)
E   ```
E   
E   Without seeing your specific bae code, I can't give exact syntax. If you'd like me to show you concrete examples or explore bae's Graph API, feel free to share more context or code!

E   Response:
E   I'll show you how to define a Node and create one for you.
E   
E   ```python
E   # %% exec
E   from cortex import Node
E   from typing import Annotated
E   
E   # Define a simple Node class
E   class GreetingNode(Node):
E       """A node that generates a personalized greeting"""
E       name: str
E       
E       def forward(self):
E           return f"Hello, {self.name}! Welcome to Cortex."
E   
E   # Create an instance of the node
E   greeting = GreetingNode(name="Claude")
E   result = greeting()
E   print(result)
E   ```
E   
E   Here's what's happening:
E   
E   1. **Define the Node**: Create a class that inherits from `Node`
E      - Add attributes (like `name`) that will be inputs
E      - Implement the `forward()` method with your logic
E      - Optionally add a docstring describing what it does
E   
E   2. **Create an instance**: Instantiate the class with values for its attributes
E   
E   3. **Execute the node**: Call it like a function with `()` to run the `forward()` method
E   
E   You can make nodes more complex by adding multiple inputs, using dependencies with `Annotated` and `Dep()`, or chaining nodes together!

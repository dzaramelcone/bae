# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** DSPy compiles agent graphs from type hints and class names - no manual prompt writing
**Current focus:** Phase 5 complete, verified — ready for Phase 6 (Node & LM Protocol)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 8 (Markers & Resolver) — COMPLETE
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Phase complete and verified (5/5 must-haves)
Last activity: 2026-02-08 — Phase 5 verified and closed

Progress: [#############.......] 65% (17/26 plans complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v2 design decisions documented in PROJECT.md v2 Design Decisions section.

Key v2 decisions affecting Phase 5:
- Use `model_construct()` for internal node creation (bypass Pydantic validation for deferred field population)
- `graphlib.TopologicalSorter` for dep chain resolution and cycle detection
- Dep on start node is allowed (auto-resolved); Recall on start node is an error
- Per-run dep caching (same dep function + args = cached result within one graph run)
- Dep.fn is first positional field so `Dep(callable)` works without keyword; v1 compat preserved via `description` kwarg
- classify_fields() skips "return" key from get_type_hints
- build_dep_dag uses id(fn) for visited set deduplication
- validate_node_deps calls build_dep_dag internally for cycle detection
- Only first marker per field processed in validation (consistent with classify_fields)
- recall_from_trace uses issubclass(field_type, target_type) direction for MRO matching
- recall_from_trace skips Dep and Recall annotated fields (infrastructure, not LLM-filled)
- resolve_dep cache keyed by callable identity (fn object), not function name
- Dep function exceptions propagate raw (no BaeError wrapping)
- resolve_fields returns only Dep and Recall field values, not plain fields

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Claude CLI session noise**: Optimizer runs create many boring test sessions that drown out real sessions in Claude CLI history. When using ClaudeCLIBackend for optimization, set the "don't save session to disk" flag to avoid polluting session history.

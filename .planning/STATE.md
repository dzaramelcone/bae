# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** DSPy compiles agent graphs from type hints and class names - no manual prompt writing
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Markers & Resolver

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 8 (Markers & Resolver)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-07 — v2.0 roadmap created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v2 design decisions documented in PROJECT.md v2 Design Decisions section.

Key v2 decisions affecting Phase 5:
- Use `model_construct()` for internal node creation (bypass Pydantic validation for deferred field population)
- `graphlib.TopologicalSorter` for dep chain resolution and cycle detection
- Dep on start node is allowed (auto-resolved); Recall on start node is an error
- Per-run dep caching (same dep function + args = cached result within one graph run)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Claude CLI session noise**: Optimizer runs create many boring test sessions that drown out real sessions in Claude CLI history. When using ClaudeCLIBackend for optimization, set the "don't save session to disk" flag to avoid polluting session history.

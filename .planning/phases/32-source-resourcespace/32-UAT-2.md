## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Package counts in read() at source root
expected: After `source()`, `read()` shows top-level packages with subpackage/module counts (e.g., "bae -- ... (2 subpackages, 9 modules)") instead of "0 classes, 0 functions"
result: pass

### 2. Module counts unchanged
expected: `read("bae.repl.ai")` still shows class/function counts (e.g., "2 classes, 5 functions"), not subpackage counts — module behavior preserved
result: pass

### 3. home() navigates to root
expected: `home()` returns orientation text listing available resourcespaces and tools. No NameError, no "homespace" anywhere.
result: pass

### 4. home() provides tools in namespace
expected: After `home()`, `read` is a callable (not NameError). `glob` and `grep` also available. These are the home-level filesystem tools.
result: pass

### 5. home() orientation lists resourcespaces
expected: `home()` output includes "Resourcespaces:" section listing `source()` (and any others) with descriptions
result: pass

### 6. back() to root returns orientation
expected: After `source()` then `back()`, result shows the same orientation output as `home()` — resourcespaces and tools listed
result: issue
reported: "breadcrumb is missing in home though"
severity: cosmetic

### 7. homespace() no longer exists
expected: Typing `homespace()` produces NameError — the name is fully removed from the namespace
result: pass

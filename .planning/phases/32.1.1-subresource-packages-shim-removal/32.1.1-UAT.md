## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Test Suite Regression
expected: All 788 tests pass with no failures or errors.
result: pass

### 2. Shims Fully Removed
expected: The old backward-compat files bae/repl/resource.py and bae/repl/source.py no longer exist. Importing from them raises ImportError.
result: pass

### 3. Role-Grouped Package Read
expected: When reading a convention-following package (one with view.py), the source resourcespace shows files grouped by role (protocol, implementation, data) rather than a flat listing.
result: pass

### 4. Meta Convention Guidance
expected: Entering the meta subresource shows orientation text mentioning the view.py/service.py convention and that view.py must implement the protocol and call service layer functions.
result: pass

### 5. Subresource Package Creation via write()
expected: Calling write() with a simple identifier name (not a file path) creates a complete subresource package directory with __init__.py, view.py, and service.py files, and auto-registers the new subresource.
result: pass

bae uses the results of experimentation on LLM attention control using structured schema and on research collected from many fields:

- cognitive science of reasoning
- programming language theory
- clinical protocol design
- formal pragmatics
- compiler engineering
- ethnomethodology

to form a clean, minimal, well-designed and mature agentic framework that is
- capable of being optimized by its own agents
- legible and coherent to human development participants

my original conception of it was the fastapi for agentic workflows

but i discovered a bunch of things as i went and realized that it could be something much greater!
- a new way of development
- a self-improving tool
- a cognitive augmentation for both humans and agents
- a way for humans and agents to cowork, cohabit, and cothink!

bae is named after my partner! i love you, amaya!

and i love claude too! thank you claude!

thanks all!
